# Required Review 

This GitHub Action will check to see if the required reviewers have accepted the PR. Will fail status checks if not. 

## Usage

This Action subscribes to [Pull request review events](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestreviewevent) which fire whenever pull requests are approved. The action requires two environment variables â€“ the label name to add and the number of required approvals. Optionally you can provide a label name to remove.
